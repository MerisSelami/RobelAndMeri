# RobelAndMeri
Starting.




# Update 1 //
Showing how to push github repositories

# Src/Server.js:19 —
 insert todo create table to implement the database for emails Src/server.js:1 — Add documentation stating the use of file & author CSS/Style:102?Area — Remove extra topnav functions to decrease latency, have the methods underneath the main call with its utilities where can be, I think you can remove a few that aren’t being used or can be optimized into one. CSS/Style:112-13 — see if the dropdown can be optimized into one that’s called with multiple methods

# Robel.MD — 
Update the readme with the new goal Keep old goals in lower font and put Update #1 in front — GitHub documents your push updates so use those are references Views/Index.pug:34-46 — Remove the header being called with the bulletin points and instead have it be under the “Body” function you created in css/style Views/Index.pug:45+ — Create footer which will have the button you created on line 44&45 so you can just call the footer for all other pages created // Not a necessity just good practice since if you made let’s say 50 pages it’d be condensed into one function that reads the post.get page URL (Saves lots of time on future projects)

# CSS/Style & CSS/Style2 & Past/Current/Future/ Main index pug -
 create a “Inspect element” obfuscation so they cannot check your code publicly
